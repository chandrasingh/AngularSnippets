This repo contains just some code snippets I am trying in the process of learning AngularJS.

Please note that server folder contains the script for a nodejs webserver. Its just an easy way to open the htmls from the localhost.
From the repo's root folder type the command "node server/script/webService.js" to run the webserver. 
It will run on port 8000, you can change that through the code!
